# naive-bayes
A class of probabilistic machine learning algorithms known as Naive Bayes is predicated on the independence of features and the Bayes Theorem. The Naive Bayes classifier makes the assumption that a feature's existence within a class is independent of all other features. An algorithm for binary and multi-class classification is called Naive Bayes.
